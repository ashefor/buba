                            1.2 We only accept stakes made online (including via mobile device or downloadable applications on a mobile device). Stakes are not accepted in any other form (ost, email, fax, etc.) and where received will be invalid and void - win or lose.

                            1.3 It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure details of their stakes are correct. Once stakes have been placed they may not be cancelled or changed by the customer. Buba reserves the right to cancel any stake at any time.

                            2.2 A stake that you request will only be valid once accepted by Buba’s servers. Each valid stake will receive a unique transaction code. We shall not be liable for the settlement of any stakes which are not issued with a unique transaction code. If you are unsure about the validity of a stake, please check your account history, or contact us.

In addition, Buba reserves the right to levy an administration charge on the customer up to the value of the deposit bonus, free and risk free stake or additional payment to cover administrative costs. Buba further reserves the right to ask any customer to provide sufficient documentation for Buba to be satisfied in its absolute discretion as to the customer’s identity prior to Buba crediting any bonus, free and risk free stake or offer to the customer’s account.

                            4.4 Buba reserves the right to withhold payment and to declare stakes on an event void if we have evidence that the following has occurred: (i) the integrity of the event has been called into question; (ii) the price(s) or pool has been manipulated; or (iii) match-rigging has taken place. Evidence of the above may be based on the size, volume or pattern of stakes placed with Buba across any or all of our staking channels. Any decision made by Buba in this regard will be conclusive. If any customer owes any money to Buba for any reason, we have the right to take that into account before making any payments to that customer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.5 Where there is evidence of a series of stakes each containing the same selection(s) having been placed by or for the same individual or syndicate of individuals, Buba reserves the right to make stakes void or withhold payment of returns pending the outcome of any subsequent investigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.6 For events where there is no official "off" declared, the advertised start time of the event will be deemed the 'off'. If for any reason a stake is inadvertently accepted after an event or match has commenced (other than live In-Play staking clearly indicated on the Website), stakes will stand providing the final outcome is not known, and that no participant/team has gained any material advantage (e.g. a score, sending off for the other team, etc.) at the time the stake was placed. If the outcome of an event/market is known Buba reserves the right to void the stake, win or lose. Disputes over times stakes are placed will be settled using the transaction log. All times stated on the Website and/or referred to by Buba staff relate to GMT unless stated otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.7 If for any reason we are unable to validate the outcome of a particular market (e.g. due to loss of live pictures), all stakes will be void, unless settlement of stakes is already determined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4.8 Where a customer gives ambiguous instructions, Buba reserves the right to split the amount of monies staked stakeween the potential outcomes. Where this is impractical we reserve the right to void the whole of that stake. In any event, the decision of Buba is final.
